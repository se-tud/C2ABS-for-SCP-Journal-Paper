# C2ABS (SCP Journal Version)
C2ABS is an Eclipse plugin that uses the AST functionality of the Eclipse CDT to extract an ABS model from a C program.
This version of C2ABS is a snapshot of the development process and is not meant as the final version.
This version follows the calculus described in "Automated Model Extraction: From Non-deterministic C Code to Active Objects" (link to journal paper will be added once available).
